	Abstract = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The} kinetic and equilibrium aspects in growing lead titanate thin film, using the reaction system {Pb(C2H5)4/Ti(OPri)4/O2/N2}, are investigated in a cold-wall reactor, especially those related to its abnormal growth on silicon oxide. Equilibrium calculations indicate that volatility of Pb-species is much higher than that of Ti-species, therefore, its concentrations in the gas phase are higher by several orders of magnitudes. Studies on {PbO}, {TiO2}, and {PbTiO3} growth show that Pb- and Ti-species deposit quite differently, and exhibit little interference with each other when deposited together. The activation energy for {PbO} deposition is estimated to be 32.1 kcal mol-1, while that for {TiO2} deposition is 6.4 kcal mol-1. Abnormal structures are found on {PbO} and {PbTiO3} films but not on {TiO2} films. The key factor in controlling film composition and abnormal structure formation is the preferential deposition of Pb-species on lead titanate over silica surface.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A predominantly (1 1 1) oriented perovskite phase was obtained at a substrate temperature of 530 {$\,^{\circ}$C.} Deposition at higher substrate temperatures resulted in the formation of a lead deficient pyrochlore phase {PbTi3O7.} The (1 1 1) orientation was slightly enhanced with an increase in the oxygen deposition pressure from 100 {mTorr} to 150 {mTorr.} A similar effect was observed with an increase in the post-deposition annealing temperature from 400 {$\,^{\circ}$C} to 600 {$\,^{\circ}$C.} {P-E} loops with remanent polarization {(Pr)} as high as 40 {[mu]C/cm2} and coercive field Ec = 105 {kV/cm} were obtained under an electric field of an amplitude of 270 {kV/cm} at 50 {kHz.} Impedance spectroscopy and leakage current behaviour of the films are also reported.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

An on/off ratio of about 2 orders of magnitude was obtained in a structure consisting of a 0.2 Î¼m ferroelectric {PbTiO3} film, a Au Schottky contact, and a {La0.5Sr0.5CoO3} Ohmic bottom electrode. The observations are explained by a model in which the depletion width of the ferroelectric Schottky diode is determined by the polarization dependence of the internal electric field at the metal-ferroelectric interface.},
