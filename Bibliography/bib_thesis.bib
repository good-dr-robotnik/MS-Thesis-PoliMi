	Abstract = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The} kinetic and equilibrium aspects in growing lead titanate thin film, using the reaction system {Pb(C2H5)4/Ti(OPri)4/O2/N2}, are investigated in a cold-wall reactor, especially those related to its abnormal growth on silicon oxide. Equilibrium calculations indicate that volatility of Pb-species is much higher than that of Ti-species, therefore, its concentrations in the gas phase are higher by several orders of magnitudes. Studies on {PbO}, {TiO2}, and {PbTiO3} growth show that Pb- and Ti-species deposit quite differently, and exhibit little interference with each other when deposited together. The activation energy for {PbO} deposition is estimated to be 32.1 kcal mol-1, while that for {TiO2} deposition is 6.4 kcal mol-1. Abnormal structures are found on {PbO} and {PbTiO3} films but not on {TiO2} films. The key factor in controlling film composition and abnormal structure formation is the preferential deposition of Pb-species on lead titanate over silica surface.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

An on/off ratio of about 2 orders of magnitude was obtained in a structure consisting of a 0.2 μm ferroelectric {PbTiO3} film, a Au Schottky contact, and a {La0.5Sr0.5CoO3} Ohmic bottom electrode. The observations are explained by a model in which the depletion width of the ferroelectric Schottky diode is determined by the polarization dependence of the internal electric field at the metal-ferroelectric interface.},

	Abstract = {Titanium dioxide, predominantly in the anatase phase with an average grain size of 5--10\&\#xa0;nm, has been synthesized by the hydrazine method. These nanocrystalline particles show a blue shift in the absorption edge of the diffuse reflectance ultraviolet spectrum of about 10\&\#xa0;nm compared to that of commercially available titania. Synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy for their structural properties and {UV-Vis} absorption spectroscopy for the bandgap studies. The absorption spectra show a linear fit for the direct transition. The optical and electrical properties of the samples have been studied and the Arrhenius plots of electrical conductivity both for the as-prepared anatase {TiO2} and the one subsequently reduced in hydrogen atmosphere at {673\&\#xa0;K} show a distinct difference in the activation energy. The hydrogen-annealed sample shows a typical semiconducting behavior whereas the as-prepared sample indicates a phonon contribution to the conductivity around {300\&\#xa0;K.}},

The electrode was prepared by spray deposition of the nanostructured material and showed high utilization (about 65\% of the theoretical capacity) and good cycling stability at discharge current of 1 C.

	Abstract = {Oxygen partial pressure in a growth process of lead oxide determines chemical and physical properties as well as crystalline structure. In order to supply oxygen, two ring-shape suppliers have been installed in a growth chamber. Films have been deposited using vacuum thermal evaporation from a raw material of yellow lead oxide powder {(5N).} Growth rate is controlled to be about 400\&\#xa0;{\AA}/s, and film thickness more than 50\&\#xa0;μm has been achieved. After deposition, the film is annealed at various temperatures under an oxygen atmosphere. In this study, an optimum growth condition for a good X-ray detector has been achieved by fine control of oxygen flow-rate and by thermal treatment. An electrical resistivity of 4.5×1012\&\#xa0;Ω\&\#xa0;cm is measured, and is comparable with the best data of {PbO.}},

@article{chingprado_raman_1995,
	Abstract = {A {PbTiO3} thin film prepared on silicon substrate by sol‐gel technique has been studied by {micro‐Raman} spectroscopy and x‐ray diffraction {(XRD).} The spectra, in comparison to the single crystal work, show high background in the low frequency region and Raman lines are broader, thus revealing the polycrystalline nature of the film. The frequencies of the Raman bands in the film are clearly shifted to lower frequencies compared to the corresponding ones in the single crystal or powder forms. This phenomenon is similar to the hydrostatic pressure effect on the Raman lines of {PbTiO3} single crystal. The film, therefore, has grains under stress. This stress is caused by nonequilibrium defects and diffusion at the interface. Measurements at different film positions showed variations in the frequency and width of the Raman bands which are associated with the stress and grain size inhomogeneities. The measured shift in the Raman frequencies suggests grain sizes ≤1 μm. {XRD} indicates grain size of around 22 nm and an average stress around 1.3 {GPa}, which was determined using the measured shift for the c‐lattice constant. {\copyright} 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {Band structure calculations and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements are used to show that Pb states determine many of the electronic properties of {Pb(Zr,Ti)O3} ferroelectric materials. The valence‐band edge consists of hybridized Pb s and O p states at all compositions. The conduction‐band minimum changes from a Ti d‐like Γ25′ state to a Pb p‐like X1 state with increasing Zr content. The Pb p character accounts for the relatively small 0.2 {eV} increase in band gap in the {Pb(Ti,Zr)O3} alloys with Zr content compared to the large 2 {eV} increase in band gap in {Ba(Ti,Zr)O3} alloys. The paramagnetic Pb3+ hole center is found to become deeper and acquire some p character as the Zr content is raised. This is attributed to the change in conduction‐band character combined with a local off‐center displacement of the Pb3+ ion. {\copyright} 1995 American Institute of Physics.},
