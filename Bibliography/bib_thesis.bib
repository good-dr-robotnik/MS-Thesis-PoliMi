	Abstract = {In-situ X-ray photoemission spectroscopy {(XPS)} has been used to investigate the initial stages of {TiO2} growth on a Si(001) substrate by atomic layer deposition {(ALD).} The core level spectra of Si 2p, C 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p were measured at every half reaction in the titanium tetra-isopropoxide {(TTIP)--H2O} {ALD} process. The ligand exchange reactions were verified using the periodic oscillation of the C 1s concentration, as well as changes in the hydroxyl concentration. {XPS} analysis revealed that {Ti2O3} and Si oxide were formed at the initial stages of {TiO2} growth. A stoichiometric {TiO2} layer was dominantly formed after two cycles and was chemically saturated after four cycles.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we investigated atomic layer deposition {(ALD)} {TiO2} thin films deposited on implantable neuro-chips based on electrolyte-oxide-semiconductor {(EOS)} junctions, implementing both efficient capacitive neuron-silicon coupling and biocompatibility for long-term implantable functionality.

The {ALD} process was performed at 295 {$\,^{\circ}$C} using titanium tetraisopropoxide and ozone as precursors on needle-shaped silicon substrates. Engineering of the capacitance of the {EOS} junctions introducing a thin {Al2O3} buffer layer between {TiO2} and silicon resulted in a further increase of the specific capacitance. Biocompatibility for long-term implantable neuroprosthetic systems was checked upon in-vitro treatment.},

	Abstract = {We show a comparative study of the {TiO2} {ALD} with {TTIP} and either O2 or O2-plasma on {Si/SiO2} substrates. In particular we compare the surface morphology and crystalline phase by means of Atomic Force Microscopy {(AFM)}, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy {(XPS)} and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy {(XAS)} for different O2-plasma procedures upon changing the time between cycles and the N2-purging pressure. The {AFM} images show that already these parameters may induce structural changes in the {TiO2} films grown by {ALD}, with the formation of crystallites with average lateral width varying between 15 and 80 nm. By means of {XAS} we also found that the crystallites have mixed anatase and rutile crystalline phases and that smaller crystallites have a greater rutile component than the larger ones.},

@article{lehnert_plasma_2012,
	Abstract = {Among many promising high-k dielectrics, {TiO2} is an interesting candidate because of its relatively high k value of over 40 and its easy integration into existing semiconductor manufacturing schemes. The most critical issues of {TiO2} are its low electrical stability and its high leakage current density. However, doping {TiO2} with Al has shown to yield significant improvement of layer quality on Ru electrodes {[S.} K. Kim et al., Adv. Mater. 20, 1429 (2008)]. In this work we investigated if atomic layer deposition {(ALD)} of Al doped {TiO2} is feasible in a batch system. Electrical characterizations were done using common electrode materials like {TiN}, {TaN}, or W. Additionally, the effect of plasma enhanced processing in this reactor was studied. For this investigation a production batch {ALD} furnace has been retrofitted with a plasma source which can be used for post deposition anneals with oxygen radicals as well as for directly plasma enhanced {ALD.} After evaluation of several Ti precursors a deposition process for {AlTiOx} with excellent film thickness and composition uniformity was developed. The effects of post deposition anneals, {Al2O3} interlayers between electrode and {TiO2}, Al doping concentration, plasma enhanced deposition and electrode material type on leakage current density are shown. An optimized {AlTiOx} deposition process on {TaN} electrodes yields to leakage current density of 5 × 10−7 A/cm2 at 2 V and k values of about 35. Thus, it could be demonstrated that a plasma enhanced batch {ALD} process for Al doped {TiO2} is feasible with acceptable leakage current density on a standard electrode material.},

@article{cleveland_role_2012,
	Abstract = {Atomic layer deposition {(ALD)} growth of {TiO2} thin films from titanium tetraisopropoxide {(TTIP)} and ozone has been studied as a function of dose and purge recipes. A novel dosing scheme was designed to introduce the {TTIP} precursor into the reaction chamber in multiple ``μpulses'' with orwithout delay times for desorption of surface product species, analogous to conventional {ALDpurge} cycles. Larger doses led to significantly higher growth rates while maintaining excellent uniformity across 100 mm wafers, effects which underscore the importance of surface residence times in rather complex surface reaction pathways. The production of {H2O/OH} surface species during the {TTIP} half-cycle is intrinsic to the reaction, leading to secondary reaction mechanisms and believed responsible for the enhanced growth rates and accompanying high uniformity.},

@article{koster_quasi-ideal_1998,
	Abstract = {In recent years, well-defined and nearly perfect single crystal surfaces of oxide perovskites have become increasingly important. A single terminated surface is a prerequisite for reproducible thin film growth and fundamental growth studies. In this work, atomic and lateral force microscopy have been used to display different terminations of {SrTiO3.} We observe hydroxylation of the topmost {SrO} layer after immersion of {SrTiO3} in water, which is used to enhance the etch-selectivity of {SrO} relative to {TiO2} in a buffered {HF} solution. We reproducibly obtain perfect and single terminated surfaces, irrespective of the initial state of polished surfaces and the {pH} value of the {HF} solution. This approach to the problem might be used for a variety of multi-component oxide single crystals. True two-dimensional reflection high-energy electron diffraction intensity oscillations are observed during homo epitaxial growth using pulsed laser deposition on these surfaces. {\copyright} 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{puurunen_surface_2005,
	Abstract = {Atomic layer deposition {(ALD)}, a chemical vapor deposition technique based on sequential self-terminating gas--solid reactions, has for about four decades been applied for manufacturing conformal inorganic material layers with thickness down to the nanometer range. Despite the numerous successful applications of material growth by {ALD}, many physicochemical processes that control {ALD} growth are not yet sufficiently understood. To increase understanding of {ALD} processes, overviews are needed not only of the existing {ALD} processes and their applications, but also of the knowledge of the surface chemistry of specific {ALD} processes. This work aims to start the overviews on specific {ALD} processes by reviewing the experimental information available on the surface chemistry of the trimethylaluminum/water process. This process is generally known as a rather ideal {ALD} process, and plenty of information is available on its surface chemistry. This in-depth summary of the surface chemistry of one representative {ALD} process aims also to provide a view on the current status of understanding the surface chemistry of {ALD}, in general. The review starts by describing the basic characteristics of {ALD}, discussing the history of {ALD---including} the question who made the first {ALD} experiments---and giving an overview of the two-reactant {ALD} processes investigated to date. Second, the basic concepts related to the surface chemistry of {ALD} are described from a generic viewpoint applicable to all {ALD} processes based on compound reactants. This description includes physicochemical requirements for self-terminating reactions, reaction kinetics, typical chemisorption mechanisms, factors causing saturation, reasons for growth of less than a monolayer per cycle, effect of the temperature and number of cycles on the growth per cycle {(GPC)}, and the growth mode. A comparison is made of three models available for estimating the sterically allowed value of {GPC} in {ALD.} Third, the experimental information on the surface chemistry in the trimethylaluminum/water {ALD} process are reviewed using the concepts developed in the second part of this review. The results are reviewed critically, with an aim to combine the information obtained in different types of investigations, such as growth experiments on flat substrates and reaction chemistry investigation on high-surface-area materials. Although the surface chemistry of the trimethylaluminum/water {ALD} process is rather well understood, systematic investigations of the reaction kinetics and the growth mode on different substrates are still missing. The last part of the review is devoted to discussing issues which may hamper surface chemistry investigations of {ALD}, such as problematic historical assumptions, nonstandard terminology, and the effect of experimental conditions on the surface chemistry of {ALD.} I hope that this review can help the newcomer get acquainted with the exciting and challenging field of surface chemistry of {ALD} and can serve as a useful guide for the specialist towards the fifth decade of {ALD} research.},

@article{Ritala_2000,
	Abstract = {A chemical approach to atomic layer deposition (ALD) of oxide thin films is reported here. Instead of using water or other compounds for an oxygen source, oxygen is obtained from a metal alkoxide, which serves as both an oxygen and a metal source when it reacts with another metal compound such as a metal chloride or a metal alkyl. These reactions generally enable deposition of oxides of many metals. With this approach, an alumina film has been deposited on silicon without creating an interfacial silicon oxide layer that otherwise forms easily. This finding adds to the other benefits of the ALD method, especially the atomic-level thickness control and excellent uniformity, and takes a major step toward the scientifically challenging and technologically important task of replacing silica as the gate dielectric in the future generations of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors.},

Equilibrium calculations indicate that volatility of Pb-species is much higher than that of Ti-species, therefore, its concentrations in the gas phase are higher by several orders of magnitudes. Studies on {PbO}, {TiO2}, and {PbTiO3} growth show that Pb- and Ti-species deposit quite differently, and exhibit little interference with each other when deposited together. The activation energy for {PbO} deposition is estimated to be 32.1 kcal mol-1, while that for {TiO2} deposition is 6.4 kcal mol-1. Abnormal structures are found on {PbO} and {PbTiO3} films but not on {TiO2} films. The key factor in controlling film composition and abnormal structure formation is the preferential deposition of Pb-species on lead titanate over silica surface.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {Titanium dioxide, predominantly in the anatase phase with an average grain size of 5--10\&\#xa0;nm, has been synthesized by the hydrazine method. These nanocrystalline particles show a blue shift in the absorption edge of the diffuse reflectance ultraviolet spectrum of about 10\&\#xa0;nm compared to that of commercially available titania. Synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy for their structural properties and {UV-Vis} absorption spectroscopy for the bandgap studies. The absorption spectra show a linear fit for the direct transition. The optical and electrical properties of the samples have been studied and the Arrhenius plots of electrical conductivity both for the as-prepared anatase {TiO2} and the one subsequently reduced in hydrogen atmosphere at {673\&\#xa0;K} show a distinct difference in the activation energy. The hydrogen-annealed sample shows a typical semiconducting behavior whereas the as-prepared sample indicates a phonon contribution to the conductivity around {300\&\#xa0;K.}},

	Abstract = {Oxygen partial pressure in a growth process of lead oxide determines chemical and physical properties as well as crystalline structure. In order to supply oxygen, two ring-shape suppliers have been installed in a growth chamber. Films have been deposited using vacuum thermal evaporation from a raw material of yellow lead oxide powder {(5N).} Growth rate is controlled to be about 400\&\#xa0;{\AA}/s, and film thickness more than 50\&\#xa0;μm has been achieved. After deposition, the film is annealed at various temperatures under an oxygen atmosphere. In this study, an optimum growth condition for a good X-ray detector has been achieved by fine control of oxygen flow-rate and by thermal treatment. An electrical resistivity of 4.5×1012\&\#xa0;Ω\&\#xa0;cm is measured, and is comparable with the best data of {PbO.}},

@article{chingprado_raman_1995,
	Abstract = {A {PbTiO3} thin film prepared on silicon substrate by sol‐gel technique has been studied by {micro‐Raman} spectroscopy and x‐ray diffraction {(XRD).} The spectra, in comparison to the single crystal work, show high background in the low frequency region and Raman lines are broader, thus revealing the polycrystalline nature of the film. The frequencies of the Raman bands in the film are clearly shifted to lower frequencies compared to the corresponding ones in the single crystal or powder forms. This phenomenon is similar to the hydrostatic pressure effect on the Raman lines of {PbTiO3} single crystal. The film, therefore, has grains under stress. This stress is caused by nonequilibrium defects and diffusion at the interface. Measurements at different film positions showed variations in the frequency and width of the Raman bands which are associated with the stress and grain size inhomogeneities. The measured shift in the Raman frequencies suggests grain sizes ≤1 μm. {XRD} indicates grain size of around 22 nm and an average stress around 1.3 {GPa}, which was determined using the measured shift for the c‐lattice constant. {\copyright} 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

The Pb3+ centers are created by optical illumination and are found to be metastable at room temperature. Their decay kinetics follow a stretched exponential function which suggests dispersive transport. The traps have the same character as the upper valence band which is formed from the hybridization of Pb s and O p states.},

@article{robertson_band_1995,
	Abstract = {Band structure calculations and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements are used to show that Pb states determine many of the electronic properties of {Pb(Zr,Ti)O3} ferroelectric materials. The valence‐band edge consists of hybridized Pb s and O p states at all compositions. The conduction‐band minimum changes from a Ti d‐like Γ25′ state to a Pb p‐like X1 state with increasing Zr content. The Pb p character accounts for the relatively small 0.2 {eV} increase in band gap in the {Pb(Ti,Zr)O3} alloys with Zr content compared to the large 2 {eV} increase in band gap in {Ba(Ti,Zr)O3} alloys. The paramagnetic Pb3+ hole center is found to become deeper and acquire some p character as the Zr content is raised. This is attributed to the change in conduction‐band character combined with a local off‐center displacement of the Pb3+ ion. {\copyright} 1995 American Institute of Physics.},
