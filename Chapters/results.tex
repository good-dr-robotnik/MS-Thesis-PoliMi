As discussed, the goal of this study was to determine methods for atomic layer deposition of ferroelectric oxides. In the process of realizing this goal there were a number of different areas of study. The first is the analysis of thermal and chemical behavior of the various potential precursors, during which TGA and DSC were primarily used (see~\vref{sec:Methods-TGA} and \vref{sec:Methods-DSC}). Secondly,  the analysis of the film growth behavior under various conditions, this was primarily measured and analyzed using the ellipsometric techniques discussed earlier (see~\vref{sec:Methods-Ellip}). Third, the film deposition needed to be tuned to produce films with a stoichiometric composition, as this was expected to produce films which would crystallize into the desired perovskite phase, see section~\vref{sec:Methods-Comp} for the methods used for this characterization. Fourth, the phase of the crystallized film was analyzed in detail to determine behavior of the films post-annealing. XRD was used extensively for this task (see~\vref{sec:Methods-XRD}).
