% Each chapter located in its own sub-file to make it easier to work on them. NOTE: they will not compile on their own. 
% To view the result, you need to run TeX on the main document (thesis.tex). Can be done by clicking on the open 
% PDF and pressing command-T. 

% NOTE: 	To get references (to figures and such) to update properly, TeX must be run TWICE. 
% 	 	To get citations to work properly, you must run: TeX (cmd-T), BibTeX (cmd-shft-B), TeX, TeX. (4 total runs)
